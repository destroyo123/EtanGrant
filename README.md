# EtanGrant
Welcome to my repo! Aint much yet, but will be soon...

# What's on here?
I'll put various projects for WREC, AIAA, Research, etc in here as they accumulate.
## WREC
WREC is the Wildcat Rocket Engineering Club at the University of Arizona. <br/>
Most of my projects are probably from this club. <br/>
This stuff is all about data acquisition and processing. <br/>
Some of it eventually might involve directly controlling rocket logic, like fill and start procedure.<br/>
