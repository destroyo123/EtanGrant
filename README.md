# EtanGrant
I'll just be putting miscellaneous projects on here...?

# What's on here?
I've got some personal projects
## WREC
WREC is the Wildcat Rocket Engineering Club at the University of Arizona. <br/>
Most of my projects are probably from this club. <br/>
This stuff is all about data acquisition and processing. <br/>
Some of it eventually might involve directly controlling rocket logic, like fill and start procedure.<br/>
